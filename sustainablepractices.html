                <h2>Sustainable and Unsustainable Fabrics</h2>

                <p>There are a variety of sustainable and unsustainable fabrics out there. Sustainable fabrics are made of organic materials and tend to last longer,
                    while unsustainable fabrics are often composed of plastics and are prone to falling appart sooner.
                </p><br>

                <h3>List of Sustainable Fabrics</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Organic Cotton</strong>
                            Organic Cotton is grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, protecting soil health and water quality. It’s usually kinder to farmers and
                            wildlife compared to conventional cotton. It still requires significant water to grow, but overall it's a better alternative to non-organic cotton.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Hemp</strong>
                            Hemp grows quickly, needs minimal pesticides and fertilizers, and returns nutrients to the soil. It uses less water than cotton and produces a durable,
                            biodegradable fiber. Additionally, hemp cultivation improves biodiversity.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Linen</strong>
                            Made from flax, linen uses fewer resources (water, pesticides) in its cultivation. It’s biodegradable and highly durable, making it a long-lasting choice.
                            Flax can also be grown on marginal land, which reduces pressure on prime farmland.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tencel (Lyocell)</strong>
                            Tencel is made from sustainably sourced wood pulp (usually eucalyptus, beech, or spruce) produced via a closed-loop process that recycles water and solvents.
                            The fabric is soft, biodegradable, and low-impact if certified. However, sustainable forestry management is key for its eco-credentials. You can learn more about
                            <a href="https://knowingfabric.com/what-is-tencel-lyocell-fabric/">what Tencel fabric is </a> or visit the <a href="https://www.tencel.com/fibers">official Tencel website</a>.</li>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Recycled Fabrics</strong>
                            These include recycled polyester (rPET), nylon, or cotton, made from post-consumer or post-industrial waste. Recycled fabrics reduce landfill waste and the
                            need for virgin inputs. The recycling process can still involve energy use, but it’s generally less intensive than creating new fibers.</li>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Bamboo (with caveats)</strong>
                            When processed mechanically (not chemically), bamboo can produce eco-friendly fabric that’s naturally antibacterial and biodegradable. Mechanically processed
                            bamboo is called bamboo linen, but most commercial bamboo fabric uses chemical-heavy processes, which can negate its sustainability.

                <h3>List of Unsustainable Fabrics</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Conventional/Non-Organic Cotton</strong><br>
                            Though natural, conventional cotton is highly resource-intensive, needing large amounts of water, pesticides, and fertilizers.
                            It contributes to soil degradation and water pollution. Cotton farming can also have serious social and health impacts on workers.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Polyester</strong>
                            A synthetic fiber made from petroleum, polyester production is energy intensive and results in significant carbon emissions. Polyester garments shed
                            microplastics during washing which end up in oceans and waterways. The fabric is not biodegradable, persisting for hundreds of years in landfills.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Nylon</strong>
                            Being petroleum-based, nylon production releases nitrous oxide which is a potent greenhouse gas. Like polyester, it sheds microplastics and doesn’t biodegrade.
                            Its manufacturing process uses toxic chemicals and high energy.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Acrylic</strong>
                            Produced from acrylonitrile, a chemical derived from fossil fuels, acrylic is highly polluting to manufacture. The fiber is not biodegradable and releases microplastics.
                            Making acrylic also involves hazardous chemicals harmful to factory workers and the environment.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Viscose/Rayon (Conventional Production)</strong>
                            Though it starts as wood pulp, most viscose is made using toxic chemicals (like carbon disulfide) that can harm factory workers and ecosystem health. Unsustainably sourced
                            pulp can also contribute to deforestation. Closed-loop production (as in Tencel) is the more sustainable alternative.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Quick tip: If shopping for clothes or textiles, look for certifications like GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard), OEKO-TEX, or sourcing information on recycled content.</p>
