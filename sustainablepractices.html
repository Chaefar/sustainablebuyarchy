                <h2>Sustainable and Unsustainable Fabrics</h2>

                <p>There are a variety of sustainable and unsustainable fabrics out there. Sustainable fabrics are made of organic materials and tend to last longer,
                    while unsustainable fabrics are often composed of plastics and are prone to falling appart sooner.
                </p><br>

                <h3>List of Sustainable Fabrics</h3><br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Organic Cotton</strong><br>
                            Organic Cotton is grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, protecting soil health and water quality. It’s usually kinder to farmers and
                            wildlife compared to conventional cotton. It still requires significant water to grow, but overall it's a better alternative to non-organic cotton.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Hemp</strong><br>
                            Hemp grows quickly, needs minimal pesticides and fertilizers, and returns nutrients to the soil. It uses less water than cotton and produces a durable,
                            biodegradable fiber. Additionally, hemp cultivation improves biodiversity.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Linen</strong><br>
                            Made from flax, linen uses fewer resources (water, pesticides) in its cultivation. It’s biodegradable and highly durable, making it a long-lasting choice.
                            Flax can also be grown on marginal land, which reduces pressure on prime farmland.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tencel (Lyocell)</strong><br>
                            Tencel is made from sustainably sourced wood pulp (usually eucalyptus, beech, or spruce) produced via a closed-loop process that recycles water and solvents.
                            The fabric is soft, biodegradable, and low-impact if certified. However, sustainable forestry management is key for its eco-credentials. You can learn more about
                            <a href="https://knowingfabric.com/what-is-tencel-lyocell-fabric/">what Tencel fabric is </a> or visit the <a href="https://www.tencel.com/fibers">official Tencel website</a>.</li>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Recycled Fabrics</strong><br>
                            These include recycled polyester (rPET), nylon, or cotton, made from post-consumer or post-industrial waste. Recycled fabrics reduce landfill waste and the
                            need for virgin inputs. The recycling process can still involve energy use, but it’s generally less intensive than creating new fibers.</li>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Bamboo (with caveats)</strong><br>
                            When processed mechanically (not chemically), bamboo can produce eco-friendly fabric that’s naturally antibacterial and biodegradable. Mechanically processed
                            bamboo is called bamboo linen, but most commercial bamboo fabric uses chemical-heavy processes, which can negate its sustainability.

                <h3>List of Unsustainable Fabrics</h3><br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Conventional/Non-Organic Cotton</strong><br>
                            Though natural, conventional cotton is highly resource-intensive, needing large amounts of water, pesticides, and fertilizers.
                            It contributes to soil degradation and water pollution. Cotton farming can also have serious social and health impacts on workers.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Polyester</strong><br>
                            A synthetic fiber made from petroleum, polyester production is energy intensive and results in significant carbon emissions. Polyester garments shed
                            microplastics during washing which end up in oceans and waterways. The fabric is not biodegradable, persisting for hundreds of years in landfills.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Nylon</strong><br>
                            Being petroleum-based, nylon production releases nitrous oxide which is a potent greenhouse gas. Like polyester, it sheds microplastics and doesn’t biodegrade.
                            Its manufacturing process uses toxic chemicals and high energy.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Acrylic</strong><br>
                            Produced from acrylonitrile, a chemical derived from fossil fuels, acrylic is highly polluting to manufacture. The fiber is not biodegradable and releases microplastics.
                            Making acrylic also involves hazardous chemicals harmful to factory workers and the environment.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Viscose/Rayon (Conventional Production)</strong><br>
                            Though it starts as wood pulp, most viscose is made using toxic chemicals (like carbon disulfide) that can harm factory workers and ecosystem health. Unsustainably sourced
                            pulp can also contribute to deforestation. Closed-loop production (as in Tencel) is the more sustainable alternative.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Quick tip: If shopping for clothes or textiles, look for certifications like GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard), OEKO-TEX, or sourcing information on recycled content.</p>

                            <p>
                                ThredUp is an American online resale platform that specializes promarily in secondhand feminine clothing, shoes, and accessories. It works like many other online retailers, like ebay.
                                If you want to sell clothes: You can request a “Clean Out Kit,” fill the provided bag with clothes you no longer want, and mail them to ThredUp (shipping is free). ThredUp then inspects,
                                sorts, photographs, and lists the items for sale on its site. Once an item sells, you get paid either as cash or store credit. There’s also an option to donate the proceeds to charity instead.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong><a href="https://www.vinted.com/">Vinted</a></strong>
                            <p>
                                Vinted is a peer-to-peer resale app where Users photograph, list, and ship items themselves. So unlike ThredUp, Vinted doesn’t act as a middleman that processes items.

                            <p>
                                Restatement is an online marketplace for new upcycled clothing, rather than used secondhand items specifically. Mainly independent clothing artists will sell their clothing on this platform,
                                and prices can get expensive due to the craftmanship. But the clothing tends to be unique, with less resemblence to fast-fashion styles.

                            <p>
                                Depop is an online marketplace for selling and buying clothes, accessories, and vintage items. It's very popular to find Y2K, streetwear, vintage, indie, and curated styles. However, many people will
                                mark up the price for items, especially if it's name-brand or is associated with popular intellectual properties. Dropshipping, which is when sellers buy items and act as third party resellers, are promenent on the site
                                This often leads to high demand items being extremely marked up in price from their actual value, so be wary.

                                Mercari is an online marketplace similar to ebay, where a plethera of items are sold and users upload and ship listings. Like Depop, dropshipping is a growing problem on this app, so be wary and
                                read item descriptions.

                    <h2>How to Take Care of Clothing</h2>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Wash Less, Wash Smarter</strong><br>
                            <p>
                                Only wash when truly needed, it's better to wash a bigger load than many smaller loads to use less water and energy. Also use cold water, it is gentler on fabrics which minimizes clothing damage over time.
                                Lastly, choose short cycles and eco-settings when available.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Use Eco-Friendly Products</strong><br>
                            <p>
                                Use biodegradable detergents and avoid fabric softeners, which can damage fibers over time. Also spot-clean stains instead of washing the whole item. Try rinsing stains in cold water and washing them off with soap.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Repair and Maintain Garments</strong><br>
                            <p>
                                If you can, learn simple mending techniques (or take items to a tailor). Try fix small garment damages early; sew loose buttons, repair small tears, and reinforce seams.
                            </p>
