        <h1 class="header">Sarah Lazarovic's Buyerarchy of Needs</h1>

            <p>
                The Buyerarchy of Needs is a visual guide that encourages more sustainable, mindful consumption. It suggests a hierarchy of choices: use what you have first,
                then borrow, swap, or thrift/buy used, and only buy new as a last resort.

                <ul>
                    <li>Definition:
                        "Buy" is the sixth or top most level and is considered the least sustainable option for fulfilling your needs. It refers to purchasing new items—especially those that haven't been previously owned or reused.
                        Lazarovic suggests buying new should be our last resort after other alternatives (reusing, borrowing, swapping, thrifting, and making) aren’t feasible.
                        When buying new, reflect on whether the item is truly necessary and if there's a more sustainable option.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Impact: Buying new items generally results in the highest environmental impact due to resource extraction, manufacturing processes, and transportation. It often involves packaging waste
                        and contributes to pollution and carbon emissions, and contributes to overconsuption and fast fasion.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Key Takeaway:
                        Ideally, we should prioritize ethical, durable, and sustainable purchases. Conscious consumption at this stage helps ensure that buying is a deliberate and well-considered act.
                        This is not about avoiding buying altogether, but being intentional about what we do buy.
                    </li>

            <div class="tab-content" id="tab2">

                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: "Make" is the fifth level and it involves crafting a new items from scratch or recycled materials. Whether through DIY projects or crafting,
                        making garments can be more personal and rewarding, but this also requires time and skill.</li><br>
                        Lazarovic notes making new items requires less attentions than previous items.
                    <li>Impact: Making your own items can be environmentally friendly, especially if you use repurposed or sustainable materials. It avoids mass production and can reduce packaging waste. However, if not done mindfully, 
                        DIY projects can still contribute to resource consumption.</li><br>
                    <li>Key Takeaway: Crafting or upcycling can reduce the amount of resources used compared to buying new.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="tab-content" id="tab3">

                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: "Thrift" is the forth level and refers to getting used items from thrift stores or online markets. It's often more economical and supports local or charitable organizations.</li><br>
                    <li>Impact: This level champions sustainability by keeping products in circulation and out of landfills. It also reduces the emissions from extraction of new materials to make garments,
                        but can still contribute to overconsumption.</li><br>
                    <li>Key Takeaway: Many items you can buy new can also be thrifted, but only thrift what you need.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="tab-content" id="tab4">

                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: "Swap" is the third level. It involves exchanging items with others, allowing both parties to get something new without purchasing.
                        This approach emphasizes reciprocal sharing and extends the lifecycle of goods. Organized swaps or informal trades are both ways to reduce
                        consumption and refresh your belongings.</li><br>
                    <li>Impact: Swapping keeps products circulating in the community, diverting them from landfills and reducing the carbon emissions of new production. It extends the useful life of items and
                        helps manage waste. Swapping also reduces packaging waste and the demand for raw materials.</li><br>
                    <li>Key Takeaway: Swapping offers a win-win; you refresh your belongings while someone else benefits from what you no longer need.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="tab-content" id="tab5">

                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: "Borrow" is the second level. It suggests borrowing from friends, family, or community resources when you need something temporarily.
                        Lending and borrowing foster connection and community, and minimize the accumulation of rarely used items.</li><br>
                    <li>Impact: Similar to Swapping, Borrowing prevents the production of additional items by sharing existing resources among multiple people. It reduces overall consumption and lessens the environmental footprint
                        associated with manufacturing and shipping. Additionally, it encourages a culture of collaborative consumption.</li><br>
                    <li>Key Takeaway: Borrowing is a sustainable way to avoid adding clutter and reduce environmental impact.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="tab-content" id="tab6">

                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: "Use is the first and most important level. This level urges use and creatively repurpose the items we already own before seeking new ones.
                        It encourages resourcefulness to shift away from a “buy first” mentality. By appreciating and caring for our own possessions, we reduce waste and unnecessary buying.</li><br>
                    <li>Impact: Using existing items eliminates the need for new resources, minimizing waste and pollution. This practice extends product life, reducing landfill contributions and
                        demand for manufacturing. It is the most sustainable choice, conserving energy and raw materials.</li><br>
                    <li>Key Takeaway: Prioritize making the most of your existing possessions, it’s the simplest way to reduce waste and consumption.</li>
                </ul>
